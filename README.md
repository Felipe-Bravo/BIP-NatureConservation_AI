## BIP on Nature Conservation and Artificial Intelligence
### Marchine learning (ML) materials (Lab handouts) 
prepared by Felipe Bravo [iuFOR](https://iufor.uva.es/) - [University of Valladolid](https://universityofvalladolid.uva.es/)
with support from Dr. Dang Kinh Bac, [Vietnam National University-University of Science](http://english.hus.vnu.edu.vn/), to import satellite images and from [Andrés Bravo-Núñez](https://github.com/andbrav/) for ML algorithms developent and [Aitor Vázquez](https://github.com/aitorvv), iuFOR - University of Valladolid, to import the raw NFI dataset.

This case study has been prepared through the Erasmus+ project VirtualForests (https://virtualforests.eu/) and was tested with the participants in the Blended Intensive Program Nature Conservation and Artificial Intelligence (https://portal3.ipb.pt/index.php/en/gri/blended-intensive-programmes) at IPB-Instituto Politécnico de Bragança, Portugal (https://portal3.ipb.pt/index.php/pt/ipb) in June 2023

This repository includes the lab instructions and the datasets to complete the assignments.
Users have to install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [QGIS](https://qgis.org/). Additionally must have an account to use https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/.

These materials have used by the author during regular master quantitative forestry courses at [University of Valladolid](http://www.uva.es), Spain and the mobility week at [IPB-Instituto Politecnico de Bragança](https://ipb.pt) in 2023

Before we start with the hands-on exercice we could watch this video on the opportunity of [artificial intelligence in forest management](https://youtu.be/KwxlRL58wwk) and this other about a project to [use AI to insight on ingrowth in complex forests](https://youtu.be/uDXTeGjYKok)

After you will complete the hands-on exercice your will realize that normally in forest science ground data are scarce while machine learning algorithms tend to work better when more data are available. This video on [data augmentation](https://youtu.be/rH4GCkLa8uY) can provide ideas about how to get synthetic data to expand our datasets.

If interested in get more information you can watch whole [Conference Artificial Intelligence and Ecosystems Management](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsdzTKpJZZa5AL_644xLZjn25HxPpIW_F) organized by [SMART Global Ecosystems](https://smartglobalecosystems.uva.es/) and [iuFOR](https://iufor.uva.es) at Palencia (Spain), April 17th-21st 2023
